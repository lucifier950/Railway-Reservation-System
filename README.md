🚆 Railway Reservation System

A Railway Reservation System built using C++ (backend) and HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend).
This project simulates a basic railway ticket booking workflow including user login, ticket reservation, and backend processing.

📌 Project Overview

This system demonstrates how a traditional console-based C++ backend can interact with a web-based frontend.
It is designed as an academic project to showcase Object-Oriented Programming, file handling, and basic frontend integration.

🧩 Features

🔐 User Login Interface

🚆 Train reservation logic (backend)

🎟️ Ticket booking handling using C++

📂 File-based data management

🌐 Simple web UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🧠 OOP concepts like classes, objects, and functions
